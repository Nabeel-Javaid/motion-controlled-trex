ðŸ”§ DEBUGGING GUIDE - T-Rex Gesture Control
===========================================

If the gesture control isn't working, follow these steps:

1. OPEN THE BROWSER CONSOLE
   - Right-click on the page â†’ "Inspect" â†’ "Console" tab
   - This will show debug messages

2. CHECK CAMERA ACCESS
   - Make sure you clicked "Allow" when browser asked for camera permission
   - You should see yourself in the camera feed on the right side

3. TEST MANUAL JUMP
   - Click the "ðŸš€ Test Jump" button
   - If this works, the game communication is fine
   - If this doesn't work, there's an iframe issue

4. CHECK HAND DETECTION
   - Hold your hand in front of camera
   - You should see green lines/dots drawn on your hand
   - Check console for debug messages showing hand coordinates

5. TEST GESTURE DETECTION
   - Make a fist (all fingers closed)
   - Slowly lift your index finger while keeping others closed
   - Watch the status text change
   - Check console for gesture detection logs

6. COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:

   a) No camera feed:
      - Refresh page and allow camera access
      - Try different browser (Chrome works best)
      - Check if another app is using camera

   b) Hand detected but no gesture:
      - Make sure you lift ONLY index finger
      - Keep other fingers clearly closed
      - Try better lighting
      - Adjust distance from camera (1-2 feet)

   c) Gesture detected but T-Rex doesn't jump:
      - Check console for "JUMP DETECTED" messages
      - Try clicking "Test Jump" button
      - Make sure game iframe is loaded
      - Try clicking inside the game area first

7. CONSOLE DEBUG MESSAGES TO LOOK FOR:
   - "Camera status: active" - camera working
   - "Hand detection: active" - hand tracking working
   - "indexExtended: true" - finger position detected
   - "JUMP DETECTED!" - gesture recognized
   - "Event sent to iframe" - jump command sent

8. PERFECT GESTURE TECHNIQUE:
   - Start with closed fist
   - Quickly extend index finger up
   - Keep other fingers closed
   - Lower index finger back down
   - Repeat for each jump

If nothing works, try:
- Refresh the page
- Use Chrome browser
- Check internet connection (MediaPipe loads from CDN)
- Try the Python version: python gesture_control.py
